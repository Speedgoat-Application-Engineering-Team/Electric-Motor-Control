%% *Description*
% 
% 
% The <https://www.speedgoat.com/products-services/demo-kits/electric-motor-control 
% Electric Control Motor Kit> together with its companion<matlab:open('GettingStarted.html')  
% Electric Motor Control reference application>, have been created to get you 
% started with <matlab:open('RCP.html') Rapid Control Prototyping> of electric 
% motors with Simulink and Speedgoat hardware. The complete hardware/software 
% is packaged to let you to rapidly start spinning and brushless DC motor in open-loop 
% and closed-loop control.
% 
% The Electric Motor Control kit was designed to be used with a Speedgoat target 
% computer fitting a <https://www.speedgoat.com/products/simulink-programmable-fpgas-fpga-i-o-modules-io397 
% IO397 FPGA I/O Module>. The latter can typically run algorithms with closed-loop 
% rates in the MHz range, can handle signal conditioning up to 250 MHz, and has 
% I/O connectivity including high-speed analog I/O, PWM, quadrature encoder measurement, 
% encoder and hall sensor measurement, and many more.
% 
% The Electric Motor Control Kit consists of a the following main hardware components:
%% 
% # 3-phase inverter rated for 60V and 20A from Speedgoat (<matlab:open('PWR-TPI6020 
% - Product Brief.pdf') Product brief>)
% # 100W 3-phase brushless DC motor from Maxon Motor (<matlab:open('PWR-TPI6020

%% Exercises
% 
%% Safety Guidelines
% Intended Use
% The Electric Motor Control Kit  have been designed, developed, and manufactured 
% for evaluation of the real-time products from MathWorks and Speedgoat. This 
% product was not designed, developed, or manufactured for any use involving serious 
% risks or hazards that could lead to death, injury, serious physical damage or 
% loss of any kind without the implementation of exceptionally stringent safety 
% precautions. In particular, such risks and hazards include the use of these 
% devices to monitor nuclear reactions in nuclear power plants, their use in flight 
% control or flight safety systems as well as in the control of mass transportation 
% systems, medical life support systems or weapons systems.
% Protection Against Electrostatic Discharge
% Electrical components that can be damaged by electrostatic discharge (ESD) 
% must be handled accordingly.
% Packaging
% Electrical Components with Housing
% Does not require special ESD packaging but must be handled properly.
% Electrical Components without housing
% Must be protected by ESD-suitable packaging.
% Policies and Procedures
% Electronic devices are never completely failsafe. If the system fails, the 
% user is responsible for ensuring that other connected devices, e.g. motors, 
% are brought to a secure state.
% 
% Safety precautions relevant to industrial control systems (e.g. the provision 
% of safety devices such as emergency stop circuits, etc.) must be observed in 
% accordance with applicable national and international regulations. The same 
% applies for all other devices connected to the system, such as drives.
% 
% All tasks such as the installation, commissioning and servicing of devices 
% are only permitted to be carried out by qualified personnel. Qualified personnel 
% are those familiar with the transport, mounting, installation, commissioning 
% and operation of devices who also have the appropriate qualifications (e.g. 
% IEC 60364). National accident prevention regulations must be observed.
% 
% Safety notices, connection descriptions (type plate and documentation) and 
% limit values listed in the technical data are to be read carefully before installation 
% and commissioning and must be observed.
% Transport and Storage
% During transport and storage, devices must be protected against undue stress 
% (mechanical loads, temperature, humidity, aggressive atmospheres, etc.).
% Installation
%% 
% * Installation must be performed according to the Speedgoat documentation 
% for the real-time target machine. Devices may only be installed by qualified 
% personnel without voltage applied. Before installation, voltage to the control 
% cabinet must be switched off and prevented from being switched on again.
% * General safety guidelines and national accident prevention regulations must 
% be observed.
% * Electrical installation must be carried out according to applicable guidelines 
% (e.g. line cross sections, fuses, protective ground connections).
% Operation
% Protection Against Touching Electrical Parts
% To operate, it may be necessary for certain parts to carry dangerous voltage 
% levels over 42 VDC. Touching one of these parts can result in a life-threatening 
% electric shock. This could lead to death, severe injury or damage to equipment. 
% 
% Before turning on the real-time target machine, the housing must be properly 
% grounded. Ground connections must be established even when testing/operating 
% devices or the uninterruptible power supply for a short time!
% 
% Before turning the device on, all parts that carry voltage must be securely 
% covered. During operation, all covers must remain closed.
% Environmental Conditions – Dust, Humidity, Aggressive Gases
% Use in very dusty environments should be avoided. Dust accumulation on the 
% devices can affect functionality.
% 
% The presence of aggressive gases can also lead to malfunctions. When combined 
% with high temperature and humidity, aggressive gases – e.g. with sulfur, nitrogen 
% and chlorine components – can induce chemical reactions that can damage electronic 
% components very quickly. A sign of the presence of aggressive gases are blackened 
% cable ends on existing equipment.
% Viruses and Dangerous Programs
% When connected wiht a speedgoat target compuert or embedded controller, the 
% unit is subject to potential risk each time data is exchanged or software is 
% installed from a data medium (e.g. USB flash drive, etc.), a network connection 
% or the Internet. The user is responsible for assessing these dangers, implementing 
% preventive measures such as virus protection, firewalls, etc. and making sure 
% that software is only obtained from trusted sources.
